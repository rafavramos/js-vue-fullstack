# js-vue-fullstack
The first contact with full-stack languages.

This project was done at Cataline's bootcamp.

It is a task manager, using javascript language and a bit of Vue.js for the front-end.

For the backend was used node.js and json.

More projects are in progress at the bootcamp, where new skills are being learned.
